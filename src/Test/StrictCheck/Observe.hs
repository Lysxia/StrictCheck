{-| This module implements the core "trick" of StrictCheck: observing the
    demand behavior of a function in a purely functional way.

    All the functions in this module are safe and referentially transparent.

    Observing the evaluation of a function using these functions incurs at most
    a small constant multiple of overhead compared to just executing the function
    with no observation.

-- | Observe the demand behavior
--
-- * in a given evaluation context,
-- * of a given __unary function__,
-- * called upon a given input,
--
-- returning a pair of
--
-- * the demand on its output exerted by the evaluation context, and
-- * the demand on its input this induced
--
-- Suppose we want to see how strict @reverse@ is when we evaluate its result
-- to weak-head normal form:
--
-- >>> (b, a) = observe1 (`seq` ()) (reverse @Int) [1, 2, 3]
-- >>> printDemand b  -- output demand
-- _ : _
-- >>> printDemand a  -- input demand
-- _ : _ : _ : _ : []
--
-- This tells us that our context did indeed evaluate the result of @reverse@
-- to force only its first constructor, and that doing so required the entire
-- spine of the list to be evaluated, but did not evaluate any of its elements.

  --   1. Running the Demand action should always result in a consistent state
  --      and not depend on when its result is forced.
  --   2. We want to evaluate the input as little as possible. Importantly
  --      running the demand action should never force any previously unforced
  --      parts of the input. This is especially important for the observe
  --      functions and the hardest thing to get right.
